## karl haines' qtile config
Welcome, and thanks for being interested. After much experimentation and
many hours of reading documentation and pure hacking as well, this is
probably the 3rd complete revamp I've done concerning my qtile configuration.

I'm somewhat of a minimalist, but I do like some transparency and some
nerd fonts and whatnot, so this is what I've come up with. A very small
config that suits me perfectly.

For visual effects, I'm using mostly qt apps, I am using the dracula theme,
and I have applied that theme to gtk as well. I'm using the qt config
tool in combination with kvantummanager and lxappearance to configure
my theme and it seems to be working pretty well. I'm using xsettingsd
to make sure that everything gets the same message and have mostly
been successful.

I'll add a screenshot or two here shortly.

## Thanks for visiting!
